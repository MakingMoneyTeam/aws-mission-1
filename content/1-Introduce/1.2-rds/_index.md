#### Benifits

- Automated backups, restores, and snapshots.
- Automated software patching and upgrades.
- Automated scaling of storage and compute capacity.
- Automated failover and high availability.
- Automated encryption and security.

Amazon RDS also provides you with the flexibility to **_customize_** your database settings, such as:

- Choosing the database engine and version
- Choosing the instance type and size
- Choosing the storage type and size
- Choosing the availability zone and region
- Choosing the security group and VPC

- Choosing the maintenance window and backup window

With Amazon RDS, you can focus on your application logic and data, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure and administration of your database.

You can also leverage the integration of Amazon RDS with other AWS services, such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon Lambda, and Amazon CloudFormation.
