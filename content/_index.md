# Deploy Spring Boot Application

## Overall

This project is part of our school curriculum and marks our first attempt at deploying a project to end users. In this workshop, we will demonstrate the deployment of a Spring Boot and MySQL project using AWS services.

This is one of the simplest deployment methods, but it has many drawbacks in the product CI/CD process. In the future, we hope to utilize more AWS services such as AWS Beanstalk, CodeCommit, CodeDeploy, etc. to optimize the CI/CD process and ensure high system availability.
